    <p>Examify is a desktop application developed to reduce the complexity of exam scheduling processes in universities and to assist Student Affairs departments.</p>
    <p>Examify takes student, course, capacity, and classroom information as CSV or JSON files and uses this data to automatically generate an exam schedule. It prevents students from having two exams at the same time or consecutive exams. The system plans a maximum of two exams per day for each student and considers classroom capacities during the scheduling process, arranging classrooms accordingly. As a result, a more practical and manageable exam timetable is created for both students and administrative units.</p>
    <p>The generated exam schedules can be easily viewed, and searches can be performed within the schedule using various filters such as student, day, course, and classroom. When necessary, schedule-related information can be edited, the schedule can be regenerated, and the final version can be exported in PDF, CSV, Excel, or JSON formats. Examify is a fully standalone application and does not require any additional software or service.</p>
    <p>The application supports both Turkish and English languages and features a simple user interface. Aiming to make the exam scheduling process less stressful, more controlled, faster, more efficient, and fair, this application has been developed as part of the SE 302 course.</p>
    <p><b>We wish you an easy and enjoyable exam scheduling experience.</b></p>
